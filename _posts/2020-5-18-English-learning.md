description: too，very，absolutely, too much, too many
---
- Too describes something negative or unwanted. Very makes the adjective stronger. The words not too with an adjective shows that there isn't a problem.
- We don't use very with strong adjectives.Use absolutely to make strong adjectives even stronger
- We use (not) enough with adjectives and nouns to talk about the right amount of something. (Not) enough comes after an adjective or before a noun
- We use too with much and many to talk about an amount or number of something that is more than we want or need. Too many goes with countable nouns. Too much goes with uncountable nouns.
## too and very

- The word **too** shows there is **a problem, or something bad**. Look at some more examples.

*Goldilocks sat in the first chair, but it was **too** big. (The problem is the size of the chair: it is big and Goldilocks is small, so she can't get comfortable.)*

*Goldilocks lay down in the first bed, but it was **too** hard. (This time, the problem is the softness of the bed. It's hard, so Goldilocks can't rest comfortably.)*

*I really like these boots, but they're **too** expensive. (The problem is the price of the boots: I can't afford to buy them.)*

*I was **too** busy to take a break, so I missed my TV programme. (I had a lot of work and this was a problem because I couldn't take a break and watch TV.)*

- The form is too + adjective.

too hot
too cold
too big  

- BE CAREFUL: If we say a sentence with too in the **negative form, then we mean it isn't a problem**. The form is **not + too + adjective**.

*I can eat this porridge - it's not **too hot** and it's not too cold.*

-----
- Very + adjective

*Goldilocks was **very** tired. Do you think this is just normal tiredness or something more? Well, the word very makes the adjective stronger.*
*Goldilocks was **very** tired so she went to sleep in the baby bear's bed.*

- The form is **very + adjective**. Here are some more examples.

*Papa bear was **very** angry because someone had slept in his bed.*
*I like your shoes - they're **very** nice!
That English test wasn't **very** difficult! Studying with BBC Learning English really helps!*

- BE CAREFUL: We **don't use very with strong adjectives**. Look here:

*Goldilocks was terrified! (The word terrified already means 'very scared', so we don't say 'very terrified'.)*
****
- **To make strong adjectives even stronger, use absolutely.**

*That was the worst play I have ever seen in my life - it was absolutely terrible!*

*I've been working day and night - I'm absolutely exhausted!*

- Other strong adjectives are: excellent, enormous, correct, incredible, dreadful, perfect.

*We hope that one day you will have absolutely excellent English!*

**Summary:too means there is some kind of problem and very makes adjectives stronger. You've also learnt about strong adjectives and absolutely.**

##  [enough, too much and too many](https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-19/session-2/activity-2#navIndex-3)
- We use **enough and not enough with adjectives** in English to talk about the right amount of a **thing or a quality**.
*This computer is powerful enough for all your video editing needs. (The computer has the right amount of power to do all types of video editing.)*

- The form is **adjective + enough** in positive sentences or **not + adjective + enough** in negative sentences.


- Another way we use enough and not enough in English is with **nouns**, to say whether there is the right **amount of something**.
* There was enough porridge for Goldilocks to satisfy her appetite. (She ate it all and wasn't hungry after - it was the right amount.)*
- We use **too much and too many** in English to talk about an amount of something that **causes a problem** because it is more than we want or need.    
- We use **too many with countable nouns**, like rules and people. We use **too much with uncountable nouns**, like salt and chocolate.

## [intonation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-27/session-2/activity-2)   
The way you make your voice go up and down when you speak is called intonation, and it's really important for questions. In English, questions that you can answer yes or no usually go up at the end - they have rising intonation. Questions that ask for certain information, with question words like when or where, tend to go down - they have falling intonation.

When we use question tags, our intonation can change the meaning and purpose of our question.

Firstly, we might be asking a question that we really don't know the answer to.( **up**)   
Secondly, we might be using a question tag to check something we think is true. (**down**)   
Thirdly, we might use a question tag to start a conversation.(**down**)   
Here is one question tag and three possible meanings depending on the intonation:   
You're our new designer, aren't you? (With the voice going up/rising intonation: this is a real question and the speaker doesn't know the answer.)

You're our new designer, aren't you? (With the voice going down/falling intonation: the speaker thinks they know the answer to the question and wants to check.)

You're our new designer, aren't you? (With the voice going down/falling intonation: the speaker is expressing interest and wants to start a conversation.)

So remember, when a person says a question tag and their voice goes up, they probably don't know the answer. If their voice goes down, they might just be checking what they think is true!
